# JS Documentation (WIP)

This documentation set is a work in progress and experimental.

Short status note from the author:

> The JS documentation generation and population process is ongoing. Some files are autogenerated stubs, others have been populated with first-pass descriptions extracted from source. I am not fully happy with the results yet — the docs are incomplete, sometimes terse, and may contain inaccuracies. I'm sorry for the rough edges.

What this means for you:

- Many reference pages were auto-generated to provide quick navigation and a starting point for further improvements.
- Expect incomplete parameter descriptions, occasional missing examples, and some functions that need manual review.

How you can help or contribute:

- If you know a specific module well (for example `mw_objcol.js`, `mwuihelpers.js` or the `inputs/` widgets), please edit the corresponding markdown file under `docs/jsdoc/reference/` or `docs/jsdoc/classes/` and improve descriptions, parameter lists and examples.
- If you prefer, open an issue listing high-priority files to polish and I'll prioritize them.

Planned next steps:

- Continue automatic population and then a targeted manual enrichment of high-value modules.
- Add cross-links, types, and more usage examples.

Thanks for your patience — I'll keep iterating until this is in a state you're happy with.
